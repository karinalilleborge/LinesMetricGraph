# LinesMetricGraph
We provide supplementary code to the existing MetricGraph (https://github.com/davidbolin/MetricGraph) for representing point and line support for models in inlabru (https://github.com/inlabru-org/inlabru). The code is also available at https://github.com/inlabru-org/fmesher/blob/feature/MetricGraphPaper/R/metric_graph.R on branch `feature/MetricGraphPaper`.

You can copy this repository and run it on your local computer/laptop. All code needed is in `metric_graph.R` and you can get the functionality by running
```
source("metric_graph.R")
```
in your R-environment. 

Please make sure you have the newest versions of the dependent packages: `rSPDE`. `MetricGraph` and `inlabru`.

If you have any questions, please refer to
